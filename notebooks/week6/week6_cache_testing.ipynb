    "## Week 6 Focus Areas\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Objectives\n",
    "- **Redis Caching**: Intelligent response caching built into RAG endpoints\n",
    "- **LangFuse Observability**: End-to-end tracing and analytics\n",
    "- **Performance Optimization**: Sub-second responses for cached queries\n",
    "- **Production Monitoring**: Real-time metrics and debugging\n",

    "### What We'll Test In This Notebook\n",
    "1. **Service Health Check** - Verify all components including Redis & LangFuse\n",
    "2. **Cache Performance** - Compare first vs cached query response times\n",
